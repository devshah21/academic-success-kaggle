# Academic Success Kaggle Competition

This github repository contains my code for this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e6/overview) competition, which attempts to classify which students are likely to succeed depending on various datapoints / factors. This repository contains code for different model architectures i.e Random Forest, Logistic Regression, & a Neural Network. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)
